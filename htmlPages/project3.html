      <h3 class="description">
        A full-stack e-commerce web application that redefines online shopping with facial recognition-based security, automated user verification, and an intuitive user interface. From login to order delivery, every step is streamlined using smart technology — including chatbot assistance and camera-based identity checks for secure order handover.
The system also features SnapTrack, a smart delivery verification system that uses device-embedded camera technology to verify temporary owners at the time of delivery, ensuring that each package reaches the right person with absolute security and transparency.

  <h2>About the Project</h2>
  <p>This Amazon Clone is not just another shopping replica — it's a reimagined version of online retail infused with security, AI, and smart logistics.</p>
  <p>Built with React.js for a responsive and interactive frontend, the app integrates advanced features like facial recognition for secure login, chatbot-based customer service, and a proprietary smart delivery mechanism called <strong>SnapTrack</strong>.</p>
  <p>SnapTrack ensures that packages are delivered only after verifying the recipient’s identity via a camera-based system, enhancing trust and reducing fraud.</p>
